<li>Install Wordfence automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. </li>
<li>Activate the Wordfence through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress. Wordfence is now activated.</li>
<li>Go to the scan menu and start your first scan. Scheduled scanning will also be enabled.</li>
<li>Once your first scan has completed, a list of threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.</li>
<li>Visit the Wordfence options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.</li>
<li>Optionally, change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual scanning and protection options for your site.</li>
<li>Click the “Live Traffic” menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.</li>
</ol>,<p>To install the Wordfence on WordPress Multi-Site installations:</p>,<ol>
<li>Install Wordfence via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.</li>
<li>Network Activate Wordfence. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option disappears. </li>
<li>Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence will not appear on any individual site’s menu. </li>
<li>Go to the “Scan” menu and start your first scan. </li>
<li>Wordfence will do a scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. </li>
<li>Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. </li>
<li>Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures.

<li>Deactivate and uninstall any other caching plugin you may be using. Pay special attention if you have customized the rewrite rules for fancy permalinks, have previously installed a caching plugin or have any browser caching rules as W3TC will automate management of all best practices. Also make sure wp-content/ and wp-content/uploads/ (temporarily) have 777 permissions before proceeding, e.g. in the terminal: <code># chmod 777 /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/wp-content/</code> using your web hosting control panel or your FTP / SSH account.</li>
<li>Login as an administrator to your WordPress Admin account. Using the “Add New” menu option under the “Plugins” section of the navigation, you can either search for: w3 total cache or if you’ve downloaded the plugin already, click the “Upload” link, find the .zip file you download and then click “Install Now”. Or you can unzip and FTP upload the plugin to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/). In either case, when done wp-content/plugins/w3-total-cache/ should exist.</li>
<li>Locate and activate the plugin on the “Plugins” page. Page caching will <strong>automatically be running</strong> in basic mode. Set the permissions of wp-content and wp-content/uploads back to 755, e.g. in the terminal: <code># chmod 755 /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/wp-content/</code>.</li>
<li>Now click the “Settings” link to proceed to the “General Settings” tab; in most cases, “disk enhanced” mode for page cache is a “good” starting point.</li>
<li>The “Compatibility mode” option found in the advanced section of the “Page Cache Settings” tab will enable functionality that optimizes the interoperablity of caching with WordPress, is disabled by default, but highly recommended. Years of testing in hundreds of thousands of installations have helped us learn how to make caching behave well with WordPress. The tradeoff is that disk enhanced page cache performance under load tests will be decreased by ~20% at scale.</li>
<li><em>Recommended:</em> On the “Minify Settings” tab, all of the recommended settings are preset. If auto mode causes issues with your web site’s layout, switch to manual mode and use the help button to simplify discovery of your CSS and JS files and groups. Pay close attention to the method and location of your JS group embeddings. See the plugin’s FAQ for more information on usage.</li>
<li><em>Recommended:</em> On the “Browser Cache” tab, HTTP compression is enabled by default. Make sure to enable other options to suit your goals.</li>
<li><em>Recommended:</em> If you already have a content delivery network (CDN) provider, proceed to the “Content Delivery Network” tab and populate the fields and set your preferences. If you do not use the Media Library, you will need to import your images etc into the default locations. Use the Media Library Import Tool on the “Content Delivery Network” tab to perform this task. If you do not have a CDN provider, you can still improve your site’s performance using the “Self-hosted” method. On your own server, create a subdomain and matching DNS Zone record; e.g. static.domain.com and configure FTP options on the “Content Delivery Network” tab accordingly. Be sure to FTP upload the appropriate files, using the available upload buttons.</li>
<li><em>Optional:</em> On the “Database Cache” tab, the recommended settings are preset. If using a shared hosting account use the “disk” method with caution, the response time of the disk may not be fast enough, so this option is disabled by default. Try object caching instead for shared hosting.</li>
<li><em>Optional:</em> On the “Object Cache” tab, all of the recommended settings are preset. If using a shared hosting account use the “disk” method with caution, the response time of the disk may not be fast enough, so this option is disabled by default.

<li>That’s it. The configuring and options are in the usual widget admin interface.</li>
</ol>,<h4>Configuration</h4>,<p>Aside from logic against your widgets, there are three options added to the foot of the widget admin page (see screenshots).</p>,<ul>
<li>
<p>Add ‘widget_content’ filter — This allows you to modify the text output in all widgets. You need to know how to write a WP filter, though some basics are covered in <a href=""../other_notes/"" rel=""nofollow"">Other Notes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use ‘wp_reset_query’ fix — Many features of WP, as well as the many themes and plugins out there, can mess with the conditional tags, such that is_home is NOT true on the home page. This can often be fixed with a quick wp_reset_query() statement just before the widgets are called, and this option puts that in for you rather than having to resort to code editing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load logic — This option allows you to set the point in the page load at which your widget logic if first checked. Pre v.50 it was when the ‘wp_head’ trigger happened, ie during the creation of the HTML’s HEAD block. Many themes didn’t call wp_head, which was a problem.

<p>You may need to delay the load if your logic depends on functions defined, eg in the theme functions.php file. Conversely you may want the load early so that the widget count is calculated correctly, eg to show an alternative layour or content when a sidebar has no widgets.</p>

Let's check out:</span><span class='dthird'><h2>How to Install Widget Logic WordPress Plugin?</h2></span> <span class='descplugin'><h2 id=""installation-header"">Installation</h2><ol>
<li>Upload <code>widget-logic.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress</li>
<li>That’s it. The configuring and options are in the usual widget admin interface.</li>
</ol><h4>Configuration</h4><p>Aside from logic against your widgets, there are three options added to the foot of the widget admin page (see screenshots).</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Add ‘widget_content’ filter — This allows you to modify the text output in all widgets. You need to know how to write a WP filter, though some basics are covered in <a href=""../other_notes/"" rel=""nofollow"">Other Notes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use ‘wp_reset_query’ fix — Many features of WP, as well as the many themes and plugins out there, can mess with the conditional tags, such that is_home is NOT true on the home page. This can often be fixed with a quick wp_reset_query() statement just before the widgets are called, and this option puts that in for you rather than having to resort to code editing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load logic — This option allows you to set the point in the page load at which your widget logic if first checked. Pre v.50 it was when the ‘wp_head’ trigger happened, ie during the creation of the HTML’s HEAD block. Many themes didn’t call wp_head, which was a problem. From v.50 it happens, by default, as early as possible, which is as soon as the plugin loads. You can now specify these ‘late load’ points (in chronological order):</p>
<ul>
<li>after the theme loads (after_setup_theme trigger)</li>
<li>when all PHP loaded (wp_loaded trigger)</li>
<li>after query variables set (parse_query) – this is the default</li>

</ol>,<h4>Shareaholic Shortcode Support / Manual Usage</h4>,<p>You can place Share Buttons, Related Content and any other Shareaholic apps manually wherever you’re like in your theme. Simply insert the following Shortcode where you want the corresponding app to appear:</p>,<pre><code>[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;""]
[shareaholic app=""recommendations"" id=""&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;""]
[shareaholic app=""ad_spaces"" id=""&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;""]
[shareaholic app=""follow_buttons"" id=""&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;""]
[shareaholic app=""total_share_count""]
</code></pre>,<p>Grab the corresponding App ID from your Shareaholic Dashboard for the App you want to manually insert into your theme. If you prefer, you can also use the <code>App Name</code> instead of the <code>App ID</code>. This can be very useful for multi-site installations and theme developers who would like to bundle Shareaholic. For example:</p>,<pre><code>[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id_name=""post_below_content""]
</code></pre>,<p>If both <code>id</code> and <code>id_name</code> are defined, <code>id</code> will take priority.</p>,<p>In your PHP / theme template code, you would add:</p>,<pre><code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;""]'); ?&gt;

</code></pre>,<p>Note: optionally, you can specify <code>title</code>, <code>link</code> or <code>summary</code> as Shareaholic shortcode parameters.

Please follow the installation instructions below. <strong>Most of the support issues that arise are a result of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions</strong>.</p>,<h4>Basic Install:</h4>,<p>The best way to begin is to review the <a href=""https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/docs/videos/"" rel=""nofollow"">Initial Setup Video</a>. There is also a complete <a href=""https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">Users Guide available</a> that covers all of the plugin’s features in depth.</p>,<ol>
<li>Upload the <code>/wp-members/</code> directory and its contents to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress®</li>
</ol>,<p>You are ready to begin using WP-Members. Now follow the instructions titled “Locking down your site” below.</p>,<h4>Locking down your site:</h4>,<ul>
<li>To restrict posts, you will need to use the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> link in your posts. Content above to the “more” split will display on summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be required to login to view the entire post. You may also use the plugin’s auto excerpt setting to create post excerpts automatically. If you do not use the “more” tag or the auto excerpt setting, full post content is going to show on archive templates, unless the post is marked as hidden.</li>
<li>To begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for pages to be blocked. Unlike posts, the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> link is not necessary in the blocking of pages, but <strong>must</strong> be used if you have the “show excerpts” setting turned on for pages.</li>
<li>To protect comments, we recommend setting “Users must be registered and logged in to comment” under Settings &gt; Discussion.</li>
<li>On the Settings &gt; General page, it is recommended that you uncheck “Anyone can register”. While not required, this will prevent WP’s native registration from colliding with WP-Members, especially if you are using any of the WP-Members additional registration fields.</li>
<li>Under Settings &gt; Reading, “For each article in a feed, show” is recommended to be set to “Summary.”  WordPress installs with full feed settings by default. If you don’t change this, your feeds will show full content.</li>

Please follow the installation instructions below. <strong>Most of the support issues that arise are a result of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions</strong>.</p><h4>Basic Install:</h4><p>The best way to begin is to review the <a href=""https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/docs/videos/"" rel=""nofollow"">Initial Setup Video</a>. There is also a complete <a href=""https://rocketgeek.com/plugins/wp-members/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">Users Guide available</a> that covers all of the plugin’s features in depth.</p><ol>
<li>Upload the <code>/wp-members/</code> directory and its contents to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress®</li>
</ol><p>You are ready to begin using WP-Members. Now follow the instructions titled “Locking down your site” below.</p><h4>Locking down your site:</h4><ul>
<li>To restrict posts, you will need to use the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> link in your posts. Content above to the “more” split will display on summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be required to login to view the entire post. You may also use the plugin’s auto excerpt setting to create post excerpts automatically. If you do not use the “more” tag or the auto excerpt setting, full post content is going to show on archive templates, unless the post is marked as hidden.</li>
<li>To begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for pages to be blocked. Unlike posts, the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> link is not necessary in the blocking of pages, but <strong>must</strong> be used if you have the “show excerpts” setting turned on for pages.</li>
<li>To protect comments, we recommend setting “Users must be registered and logged in to comment” under Settings &gt; Discussion.</li>
<li>On the Settings &gt; General page, it is recommended that you uncheck “Anyone can register”. While not required, this will prevent WP’s native registration from colliding with WP-Members, especially if you are using any of the WP-Members additional registration fields.</li>
<li>Under Settings &gt; Reading, “For each article in a feed, show” is recommended to be set to “Summary.”  WordPress installs with full feed settings by default. If you don’t change this, your feeds will show full content.</li>

<li>modify a theme template file using the shortcode in a PHP function.</li>
</ol>,<h4>Using Shortcodes in the WordPress editor</h4>,<ul>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts]</code>  – Add all posts to a page (limit to what number posts in WordPress is set to), essentially adds blog “page” to page.</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts ids='1,2,3']</code> – show one or many posts by specifying the post ID(s) ( specify all post types )</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts post_type='post_type']</code> – show posts from a custom post type by specifying the post type slug ( must give post type if not a standard post ) add multiple post types by separating with commas (ex. <code>post_type='post_type1,post_type2'</code>)</li>

<li><code>[ic_add_posts orderby='title' order='ASC']</code> – orderby title – supports all WP orderby variables.  Order is optional, WP default is ‘DESC’.</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts category='category-slug']</code> – Show posts within a specific category.  Uses slugs, can have multiple but separate by commas.      category-1,category2, etc (no spaces.)</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts exclude_category='category-slug']</code> – Exclude posts within specific category. Uses slugs, can have multiple slugs separated by commas.      category-1,category2, etc (no spaces.)</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts tag='tag-slug']</code>  – Show posts using a specific tag.  Like categories, it uses slugs, and can accommodate multiple tags separate by commas.     tag-1,tag-2, etc (no spaces.)</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts tax='taxonomy' term='term']</code> – limit posts to those that exist in a taxonomy and have a specific term.  Both are required for either one to work</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts template='template-in-theme-dir.php']</code> – In case you want to style your markup, add meta data, etc.  Each shortcode can reference a different template.  These templates must exist in the theme directory.</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts ignore_sticky_posts='no']</code> – Show sticky posts too (they’re ignored by default).</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts paginate='yes']</code> – use pagination links (off by default)</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts label_next='Next' label_previous='Previous']</code> – Customize ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ labels used by pagination</li>
<li><code>[ic_add_posts post_status='private']</code> – Show posts with the specified status. By default it shows only posts with ‘publish’ status. To select multiple statuses, separate them with commas like so: <code>post_status='private,publish'</code>.</li>

Here are a few examples to get you started:</p>,<p>** Example 1 **</p>,<p>Let’s say you want to pull a specific post called <em>“What I love about coffee”</em>, which has a post ID of 34, somewhere on your About Us page.  Your shortcode should look like this:</p>,<pre><code>[ic_add_posts ids='34']
</code></pre>,<p>** Example 2 **</p>,<p>Alright, now lets say that you want to pull in all posts from two categories into your WordPress page.  One  category is <em>WordPress Rocks</em> and the other is <em>WordPress Rolls</em>.  Plus, you’d like to display them three per page, rather than the default number of posts.  Depending on your category slugs, your shortcode should probably look like this:</p>,<pre><code>[ic_add_posts category='wordpress-rocks,wordpress-rolls' showposts='3']
</code></pre>,<p>** Example 3 **</p>,<p>Now, you’re ambitious and want to try something complex.  Let’s say you’ve got a page called <em>Plugins Are Awesome</em> and, in it, you want to pull in posts that match the following criteria:</p>,<ul>
<li>posts from a custom post type called <em>Testimonials</em>,</li>
<li>posts that are in the <em>Testimonial Type</em> custom taxonomy using the term <em>Customer</em>,</li>
<li>you want to display six testimonials per page,</li>
<li>you’d like them displayed in ascending order,</li>
<li>finally, you’ve created a custom template to use in presenting these posts and named it <code>my-posts-in-page-template.php</code></li>
</ul>,<p>Your shortcode might look like this:</p>,<pre><code>[ic_add_posts showposts='6' post_type='testimonials' tax='testimonial-type' term='customer' order='ASC' template='my-posts-in-page-template.php']
</code></pre>,<h4>Using Shortcodes within a PHP function</h4>,<p>If you’d like to use this plugin to pull posts directly into your theme’s template files, you can drop the following WordPress function in your template files, replacing the <code>[shortcode]</code> part with your, custom shortcode.</p>,<pre><code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode(""[shortcode]""); ?&gt;

Simply visit the plugin settings to control which fields are displayed, set the Challenge Question, configure submitted images, and much more.</p>,<p>There are situations, however, where advanced form configuration may be required. In order to allow for this, USP makes it possible to create a custom submission form. Here are the steps:</p>,<p>First, copy these two plugin files:</p>,<pre><code>/user-submitted-posts/resources/usp.css
/user-submitted-posts/views/submission-form.php
</code></pre>,<p>Then, paste those two files into a directory named <code>/usp/</code> in your theme:</p>,<pre><code>/wp-content/themes/your-theme/usp/usp.css
/wp-content/themes/your-theme/usp/submission-form.php
</code></pre>,<p>Lastly, visit the plugin settings and change “Form style” to “Custom Form + CSS”. You now may customize the two files as desired; they will not be overwritten when the plugin is updated.</p>,<p>Alternately, you can set the option “Form style” to “HTML5 Form + Disable CSS” to use the default USP form along with your own CSS. FYI: here is a list of <a href=""https://m0n.co/e"" rel=""nofollow"">USP CSS selectors</a>.</p>,<p>Or, to go further with unlimited custom forms, <a href=""https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">check out USP Pro</a> 🙂</p>,<p><strong>Displaying submitted posts</strong></p>,<p>User-submitted posts are handled by WordPress as regular WP Posts. So they are displayed along with your other posts according to your theme design. Additionally, each submitted post includes a set of Custom Fields that include the following information:</p>,<ul>
<li><code>is_submission</code> – indicates that the post is a user-submitted post</li>
<li><code>user_submit_image</code> – the URL of the submitted image (one custom field per image)</li>
<li><code>user_submit_ip</code> – the IP address of the submitted-post author</li>
<li><code>user_submit_name</code> – the name of the submitted-post author</li>
<li><code>user_submit_url</code> – the submitted URL</li>
<li><code>usp_custom_field</code> – configurable Custom Field</li>
</ul>,<p>There are numerous ways to display these Custom Fields. The easiest way is to visit the plugin settings and configure the options available under “Auto-Display Content”. There you can enable auto-display of submitted email address, URL, and images. Note that submitted images also are uploaded to the WP Media Library.</p>,<p>For more flexibility, you can use a variety of WP Template Tags (e.g., <a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta"" rel=""nofollow"">get_post_meta()</a>) to display Custom Fields. Here are some tutorials for more information:</p>,<ul>
<li><a href=""https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">WordPress Custom Fields, Part I: The Basics</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tips-tricks/"" rel=""nofollow"">WordPress Custom Fields, Part II: Tips and Tricks</a></li>
</ul>,<p>And here are some tutorials that may help with custom display of submitted images:</p>,<ul>

<li><a href=""https://wp-mix.com/display-images-with-user-submitted-posts/"" rel=""nofollow"">Display images with links</a></li>
</ul>,<p>Also, here is a <a href=""https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-custom-field-helper-plugin/"" rel=""nofollow"">Helper Plugin to display Custom Fields</a>. It originally is designed for use with USP Pro, but also works great with the free version of USP.</p>,<p><strong>Auto Display Images</strong></p>,<p>To automatically display submitted images on the frontend, visit the plugin settings, “Images Auto-Display” and select whether to display the images before or after post content. Save changes.</p>,<p><strong>Featured Images</strong></p>,<p>To set submitted images as Featured Images (aka Post Thumbnails) for submitted posts, visit the plugin settings, “Image Uploads” and check the box to enable “Featured Image”. Save changes.</p>,<p><strong>Shortcodes</strong></p>,<p>User Submitted Posts provides a set of useful shortcodes. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more information.</p>,<pre><code>[user-submitted-posts]                        : displays the form on any Post or Page
[usp-login-form]                              : displays a login/register/password form
[usp_display_posts]                           : displays list of all submitted posts
[usp-reset-button url=""https://example.com/""] : displays a button to reset the form
[usp_access cap=""read"" deny=""""][/usp_access]  : limits access to specific user capability
[usp_visitor deny=""""][/usp_visitor]           : limits access to visitors (not logged in) only
[usp_member deny=""""][/usp_member]             : limits access to logged-in users
</code></pre>,<p>Here is more info about these shortcodes:</p>,<p><strong><code>[user-submitted-posts]</code></strong></p>,<p>Displays the post-submit form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.</p>,<p><strong><code>[usp-login-form]</code></strong></p>,<p>Displays the user-login form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.</p>,<p><strong><code>[usp_display_posts]</code></strong></p>,<p>Displays a list of all submitted posts. This shortcode accepts two optional attributes, “userid” and “numposts”. Examples:</p>,<pre><code>[usp_display_posts]                           : default displays all submitted posts by all authors
[usp_display_posts userid=""current""]          : displays all submitted posts by current logged-in user
[usp_display_posts userid=""1""]                : displays all submitted posts by registered user with ID = 1
[usp_display_posts userid=""Pat Smith""]        : displays all submitted posts by author name ""Pat Smith""
[usp_display_posts userid=""all""]              : displays all submitted posts by all users/authors
[usp_display_posts userid=""all"" numposts=""5""] : limit to 5 posts from all users
</code></pre>,<p>So the shortcode attributes can be used to customize the post list as desired. Note that the Pro version of USP provides many more options for the <a href=""https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-display-list-submitted-posts/"" rel=""nofollow"">display-posts shortcode</a>.</p>,<p><strong><code>[usp_gallery]</code></strong></p>,<p>Displays a gallery of all submitted images for the current post. Customize via the follwing attributes:</p>,<pre><code>$size   = image size as thumbnail, medium, large or full -&gt; default = thumbnail
$before = text/markup displayed before the image URL     -&gt; default = {a href='%%url%%'}{img src='
$after  = text/markup displayed after the image URL      -&gt; default = ' /}{/a}
$number = the number of images to display for each post  -&gt; default = false (display all)
$postId = an optional post ID to use                     -&gt; default = false (uses global/current post)

</code></pre>,<p>Note that the <code>url</code> attribute accepts <code>%%current%%</code> for the current URL (useful when the form is displayed in the sidebar).</p>,<p><strong><code>[usp_access]</code></strong></p>,<p>Limits access to specific user capability. Example:</p>,<pre><code>[usp_access cap=""read""]
    Content for users that have ""read"" access
[/usp_access]
</code></pre>,<p>The <code>cap</code> attribute specifies the required capability or capabilities (comma-separated). This shortcode also accepts an optional <code>deny</code> attribute. The <code>deny</code> attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use <code>{tag}</code> to display <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.</p>,<p><strong><code>[usp_visitor]</code></strong></p>,<p>Limits access to visitors (not logged in) only. Example:</p>,<pre><code>[usp_visitor]
    Content for for users who are not logged in
[/usp_visitor]
</code></pre>,<p>This shortcode accepts an optional <code>deny</code> attribute. The <code>deny</code> attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use <code>{tag}</code> to display <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.</p>,<p><strong><code>[usp_member]</code></strong></p>,<p>Limits access to logged-in users.

FYI: here is a list of <a href=""https://m0n.co/e"" rel=""nofollow"">USP CSS selectors</a>.</p><p>Or, to go further with unlimited custom forms, <a href=""https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">check out USP Pro</a> 🙂</p><p><strong>Displaying submitted posts</strong></p><p>User-submitted posts are handled by WordPress as regular WP Posts. So they are displayed along with your other posts according to your theme design. Additionally, each submitted post includes a set of Custom Fields that include the following information:</p><ul>
<li><code>is_submission</code> – indicates that the post is a user-submitted post</li>
<li><code>user_submit_image</code> – the URL of the submitted image (one custom field per image)</li>
<li><code>user_submit_ip</code> – the IP address of the submitted-post author</li>
<li><code>user_submit_name</code> – the name of the submitted-post author</li>
<li><code>user_submit_url</code> – the submitted URL</li>
<li><code>usp_custom_field</code> – configurable Custom Field</li>
</ul><p>There are numerous ways to display these Custom Fields. The easiest way is to visit the plugin settings and configure the options available under “Auto-Display Content”. There you can enable auto-display of submitted email address, URL, and images. Note that submitted images also are uploaded to the WP Media Library.</p><p>For more flexibility, you can use a variety of WP Template Tags (e.g., <a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta"" rel=""nofollow"">get_post_meta()</a>) to display Custom Fields. Here are some tutorials for more information:</p><ul>

<li><a href=""https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tips-tricks/"" rel=""nofollow"">WordPress Custom Fields, Part II: Tips and Tricks</a></li>
</ul><p>And here are some tutorials that may help with custom display of submitted images:</p><ul>
<li><a href=""https://wp-mix.com/display-images-attached-post/"" rel=""nofollow"">Display all images attached to post</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://wp-mix.com/display-images-with-user-submitted-posts/"" rel=""nofollow"">Display images with links</a></li>
</ul><p>Also, here is a <a href=""https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-custom-field-helper-plugin/"" rel=""nofollow"">Helper Plugin to display Custom Fields</a>. It originally is designed for use with USP Pro, but also works great with the free version of USP.</p><p><strong>Auto Display Images</strong></p><p>To automatically display submitted images on the frontend, visit the plugin settings, “Images Auto-Display” and select whether to display the images before or after post content. Save changes.</p><p><strong>Featured Images</strong></p><p>To set submitted images as Featured Images (aka Post Thumbnails) for submitted posts, visit the plugin settings, “Image Uploads” and check the box to enable “Featured Image”. Save changes.</p><p><strong>Shortcodes</strong></p><p>User Submitted Posts provides a set of useful shortcodes. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more information.</p><pre><code>[user-submitted-posts]                        : displays the form on any Post or Page
[usp-login-form]                              : displays a login/register/password form
[usp_display_posts]                           : displays list of all submitted posts
[usp-reset-button url=""https://example.com/""] : displays a button to reset the form
[usp_access cap=""read"" deny=""""][/usp_access]  : limits access to specific user capability
[usp_visitor deny=""""][/usp_visitor]           : limits access to visitors (not logged in) only
[usp_member deny=""""][/usp_member]             : limits access to logged-in users
</code></pre><p>Here is more info about these shortcodes:</p><p><strong><code>[user-submitted-posts]</code></strong></p><p>Displays the post-submit form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.</p><p><strong><code>[usp-login-form]</code></strong></p><p>Displays the user-login form. This shortcode does not accept any attributes.</p><p><strong><code>[usp_display_posts]</code></strong></p><p>Displays a list of all submitted posts. This shortcode accepts two optional attributes, “userid” and “numposts”. Examples:</p><pre><code>[usp_display_posts]                           : default displays all submitted posts by all authors
[usp_display_posts userid=""current""]          : displays all submitted posts by current logged-in user
[usp_display_posts userid=""1""]                : displays all submitted posts by registered user with ID = 1
[usp_display_posts userid=""Pat Smith""]        : displays all submitted posts by author name ""Pat Smith""
[usp_display_posts userid=""all""]              : displays all submitted posts by all users/authors
[usp_display_posts userid=""all"" numposts=""5""] : limit to 5 posts from all users
</code></pre><p>So the shortcode attributes can be used to customize the post list as desired. Note that the Pro version of USP provides many more options for the <a href=""https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-display-list-submitted-posts/"" rel=""nofollow"">display-posts shortcode</a>.</p><p><strong><code>[usp_gallery]</code></strong></p><p>Displays a gallery of all submitted images for the current post. Customize via the follwing attributes:</p><pre><code>$size   = image size as thumbnail, medium, large or full -&gt; default = thumbnail
$before = text/markup displayed before the image URL     -&gt; default = {a href='%%url%%'}{img src='
$after  = text/markup displayed after the image URL      -&gt; default = ' /}{/a}
$number = the number of images to display for each post  -&gt; default = false (display all)
$postId = an optional post ID to use                     -&gt; default = false (uses global/current post)

Notes: 
    Use curly brackets to output angle brackets
    Use single quotes in before/after attributes
    Can use %%url%% to get the URL of the full-size image
    Check out the source code inline notes for more info
</code></pre><p><strong><code>[usp-reset-button]</code></strong></p><p>Displays a button to reset the form. Accepts the following attributes:</p><pre><code>class  = classes for the parent element (optional, default: none)
value  = link text (optional, default: ""Reset form"")
url    = the URL where your form is displayed (required, default: none)
custom = any attributes or custom code for the link element (optional, default: none)
</code></pre><p>Note that the <code>url</code> attribute accepts <code>%%current%%</code> for the current URL (useful when the form is displayed in the sidebar).</p><p><strong><code>[usp_access]</code></strong></p><p>Limits access to specific user capability. Example:</p><pre><code>[usp_access cap=""read""]
    Content for users that have ""read"" access
[/usp_access]
</code></pre><p>The <code>cap</code> attribute specifies the required capability or capabilities (comma-separated). This shortcode also accepts an optional <code>deny</code> attribute. The <code>deny</code> attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use <code>{tag}</code> to display <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.</p><p><strong><code>[usp_visitor]</code></strong></p><p>Limits access to visitors (not logged in) only. Example:</p><pre><code>[usp_visitor]
    Content for for users who are not logged in
[/usp_visitor]
</code></pre><p>This shortcode accepts an optional <code>deny</code> attribute. The <code>deny</code> attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use <code>{tag}</code> to display <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.</p><p><strong><code>[usp_member]</code></strong></p><p>Limits access to logged-in users. Example:</p><pre><code>[usp_member]
    Content for for users who are logged in
[/usp_member]
</code></pre><p>This shortcode accepts an optional <code>deny</code> attribute. The <code>deny</code> attribute displays a message to users who are denied access. Tip: to include markup in the deny message, you can use <code>{tag}</code> to display <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>. Check out the “Display the Form” panel in the plugin settings for examples and more info.</p><p><strong>Template tags</strong></p><p>User Submitted Posts provides a set of useful template tags:</p><pre><code>/*

        usp_get_images('thumbnail', '{a href=""%%url%%""}{img src=""', '"" /}{/a}'); 
        // outputs for each image: &lt;a href=""[full-size image URL]""&gt;&lt;img src=""[image URL]"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<li>Upload <code>document-gallery</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress</li>
<li>Place <code>[dg]</code> in any posts or pages you want a document gallery included. See<br>
below for additional display options.</li>
</ol>,<h4>Document Gallery Options</h4>,<p>In order to include all compatible documents from a given page or post, you<br>
must include the following shortcode in the post: <code>[dg]</code>.</p>,<p>In addition to the default behavior, the plugin provides many options to<br>
customize behavior with various attributes, some of which are shown below:</p>,<pre><code>[dg [fancy=&lt;true/false&gt;] [attachment_pg=&lt;true/false&gt;] [descriptions=&lt;true/false&gt;] [order=&lt;ASC/DESC&gt;] [orderby=&lt;**see below**&gt;]]
</code></pre>,<p>Though the shortcode above may seem far from “short,” none of the attributes are<br>
required and most users will find that the plugin meets your needs “out of the box”<br>
without any added attributes.</p>,<p><strong>Default Values</strong></p>,<p>Default document gallery behavior can be configured in your dashboard under <code>Settings -&gt; Document Gallery</code>.</p>,<p><strong>Attachment Page Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.1)</em></p>,<p>This option determines whether each document icon will link to the actual file<br>
or to its attachment page.  If you want the user to be able to click on the<br>
icon and directly receive the option to download then use <code>attachment_pg=false</code><br>
(the default). If you have information on the attachment page that you want the<br>
link to go to, use <code>attachment_pg=true</code>.</p>,<p><strong>Categories/Custom Taxonomy Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.4)</em></p>,<p>With the <code>categories</code> option you are able to select attachments based on<br>
their assigned category or any other<br>
<a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies"" rel=""nofollow"">custom taxon</a>. Categories<br>
or any custom taxon can be referenced simply by including <code>category=category_value</code><br>
or <code>taxon_name=taxon_value</code>. Multiple values for a single taxon may be separated<br>
by commas. Note that if a taxon value contains spaces then the entire comma-<br>
delimited list must be quoted.</p>,<p><strong>Columns Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.0)</em></p>,<p>The columns option does what it sounds like — sets how many columns to use in<br>
rendering your gallery. With <code>columns=-1</code>, you will get an infinite number of<br>
columns. In other words, only 1 row with all icons.</p>,<p><strong>Descriptions Option</strong></p>,<p>If <code>true</code>, each document will take its own line with the description displayed<br>
alongside it.</p>,<p><em>Note: this will use the <code>description</code> field, <strong>not</strong> the <code>caption</code>. Be<br>
careful when entering your document data.</em></p>,<p><strong>Fancy Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 2.0)</em></p>,<p>If <code>true</code>, we will try to generate a thumbnail for each document in the gallery.<br>
The success in generating thumbs will depend mostly on what your server supports.<br>
To fine-tune how thumbnails are generated, visit <code>Settings -&gt; Document Gallery</code><br>
in your site’s dashboard.</p>,<p><strong>ID Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.0)</em></p>,<p>This option indicates from which parent post/page to retrieve attachments.<br>
If not explicitly set, the default will be the post/page where the shortcode<br>
is being used.</p>,<p>If you do not wish to filter by parent, <code>id=-1</code> will match all attachments.</p>,<p><strong>IDs Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.2)</em></p>,<p>This is an advanced option intended for experienced WordPress users. If this<br>
option is used, the plugin will ignore attached documents, instead including<br>
all attachments defined by the <code>ids</code> attribute (e.g.: <code>ids=10,2,4,42</code>).</p>,<p><em>Note: If this attribute is used, order defaults to the order of IDs given<br>
rather than menu_order unless order is explicitly stated.</em></p>,<p><strong>Images Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.2)</em></p>,<p>This option will tell the plugin to include all images attached to to a page or<br>
post in addition to all documents.</p>,<p><strong>Include/Exclude Options</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.0)</em></p>,<p>As the name suggests, these options allow for explicitly adding or removing<br>
matched attachments in your gallery. Like with the IDs options above, these<br>
options take a comma-delimited list of attachment IDs.</p>,<p><strong>Limit Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 2.3)</em></p>,<p>As the name suggests, this value will limit how many results are returned in the gallery.<br>
If set to <em>-1</em>, the limit is infinite.</p>,<p><strong>MIME Types Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.0)</em></p>,<p>This is a comma-delimited list of all<br>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type#List_of_common_media_types"" rel=""nofollow"">MIME types</a><br>
to be included in the gallery. Most users will not need to modify this value.</p>,<p>One example use-case would be to include images in your gallery (which are<br>
not included by default). To do this, you would simply set<br>
    mime_types=application,video,text,audio,image, where “image” is the only difference<br>
from the default value. You could also create a gallery which only includes PDFs<br>
by setting <code>mime_types=application/pdf</code>.</p>,<p><strong>New Window Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.2)</em></p>,<p>If true, clicking one of the documents in your gallery will open the target link in a new window/tab.</p>,<p><strong>Order Option</strong></p>,<p>This option works alongside the <code>orderby</code> option to determine whether the<br>
documents are displayed in ascending or descending order.</p>,<p><strong>Orderby Option</strong></p>,<ul>
<li><code>menu_order</code> – This is probably the one you want to use. Menu order is<br>
the order that icons appear when seen in the Insert / Upload Media Gallery<br>
dialog. To change this order, you simply drag the icons around until they<br>
are where you want them. In earlier versions of WordPress, menu_order was<br>
modified by the integer fields in the Insert / Upload Media Gallery dialog.<br>
These fields no longer exist in recent releases.</li>
<li><code>title</code> – Order by title.</li>
<li><code>date</code> – Order by upload date.</li>
<li><code>modified</code> – Order by last modified date.</li>
<li><code>rand</code> – Random order.</li>
<li><code>ID</code> – Order by post id.</li>
<li><code>author</code> – Order by author.</li>
<li><code>name</code> – Order by attachment slug.</li>
<li><code>parent</code> – Order by post/page parent id.<br>
(Only useful in conjunction with <code>localpost=false</code> option.)</li>
<li><code>comment_count</code> – Order by number of comments (available with WP &gt;= 2.9).</li>
<li><code>none</code> – No order (available with Version 2.8).</li>
<li><code>post__in</code> – Preserve post ID order given in the post__in array.</li>
</ul>,<p><strong>Relation Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.4)</em></p>,<p>The relation option should only be used when also using the <em>category or custom<br>
taxonomy</em> option (see above).</p>,<p>When using multiple taxa this option allows you to decide whether the attachments<br>
returned must match all of the different taxa specified (AND) or a minimum of one<br>
taxa match (OR).</p>,<p><em>NOTE: This has no bearing on the relationship between different terms for a single<br>
taxon (eg: <code>[dg category=x,y,z relation=AND]</code> will return any attachments where the<br>
category is x, y, OR z). If you wish to return only attachments with all 3 categories,<br>
you will instead need to use the following syntax: <code>[dg category=x,y,z category_relation=AND]</code>.<br>
This syntax of *taxon</em>_relation will work for any taxon, not just “category.”*</p>,<h4>Customize Appearance</h4>,<p>The Default Document gallery will often fit quite well with whatever theme you<br>
are using. But, if you want to change things, Document Gallery makes that easy.<br>
Just navigate to <code>Settings -&gt; Document Gallery</code> and put any custom CSS in the<br>
provided text box.</p>,<p>See <a href=""https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/document-gallery/trunk/assets/css/style.css"" rel=""nofollow""><code>style.css</code></a><br>
for all of the ids and classes being used in a Document Gallery.</p>,<p><strong>Example</strong></p>,<p>Say I would like to include a border for the right and bottom of the document<br>
icon, but only when descriptions are shown (to delineate the icon from the<br>
description text). To do this, I would need to use the following CSS:</p>,<pre><code>.document-icon-wrapper.descriptions .document-icon{
   border-right: 1px solid #37824A;
   border-bottom: 1px solid #37824A;
}
</code></pre>,<p>Now, if I wanted to modify that code to instead add the same border to all of<br>
the document-icons, regardless of whether they have a description or not, I<br>
would just change the first line, removing the descriptions class like so:</p>,<pre><code>.document-icon-wrapper .document-icon
</code></pre>,<h4>Developers</h4>,<p>For those unfamiliar with content filters, <a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference"" rel=""nofollow"">here is some<br>
documentation</a> that you<br>
should read before continuing.</p>,<p><strong>Filter HTML Output</strong></p>,<p>In Documnet Gallery version 2.2, we’ve released a more powerful HTML<br>
templating framework, making all generated output filterable, and thus<br>
configurable, by developers wishing to control the gallery output. Three<br>
different filters are provided in order to access the various segments<br>
of a gallery: <code>dg_gallery_template</code>, <code>dg_row_template</code>, and <code>dg_icon_template</code>.<br>
These filtered templates are used when dynamically generating output for each<br>
gallery.</p>,<p>Each of the following filters provides an bool argument which indicates<br>
whither the gallery being generated will display descriptions, which<br>
allows you to handle galleries with and without descriptions differently.</p>,<p>If you wish to wrap your galleries in some additional content,<br>
the <code>dg_gallery_template</code> is the tool for the job. With it you can include<br>
content prior to or following your document galleries. The filter<br>
exposes 2 special tags which are replaced during gallery generation<br>
with data specific to that gallery. The tag is described below:</p>,<ul>
<li><strong>%id%</strong>: The id attribute value for this gallery.</li>
<li><strong>%class%</strong>: The class attribute value for this gallery.</li>
<li><strong>%data%</strong>: The one ore more data-* attributes for the gallery, which are necessary for client-side operations.</li>
<li><strong>%rows%</strong>: This tag is replaced by all of the document gallery rows.<br>
Everything before this string will be rendered before the gallery and<br>
everything after this string will be rendered following the gallery.</li>
</ul>,<p>If you wish to modify how gallery rows are generated, <code>dg_row_template</code>,<br>
is provided for this purpose. This filter gives you control at the row<br>
level for how a gallery will be generated. The filter exposes 2 special tags<br>
which are replaced during gallery generation with row-specific data.<br>
These tags are as follows:</p>,<ul>
<li><strong>%class%</strong>: The class attribute value for this row.</li>
<li><strong>%icons%</strong>: The icon data for this row.</li>
</ul>,<p>If you wish to modify the HTML that wraps individual icons,<br>
the <code>dg_icon_template</code> filter is what you will use. The filter is passed<br>
two arguments which may be used to gain additional information about<br>
the document that will be used in generating this icon. The first<br>
argument is a bool value which indicates whether descriptions will<br>
be used along with the icon and the second value is an integer WordPress<br>
attachment ID which may be used to lookup any relevant information<br>
you need specific to that document. The filter exposes 5 special tags<br>
which are replaced during gallery generation with document-specific data.<br>
These tags are as follows:</p>,<ul>
<li><strong>%date%</strong>: The date that the attachment was added to WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>%description%</strong>: The attachment description (only present when rendering descriptions).</li>
<li><strong>%extension%</strong>: The document file extension.</li>
<li><strong>%img%</strong>: The URL pointing the the image that will be displayed.</li>
<li><strong>%link%</strong>: The URL that will be loaded when the user clicks the icon.</li>
<li><strong>%path%</strong>: The system path pointing to the document.</li>
<li><strong>%size%</strong>: The human-readable file size formatted by<br>
<a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/size_format"" rel=""nofollow"">size_format</a>.</li>
<li><strong>%target%</strong>: The target attribute for the anchor tag (e.g.: _blank, _self).</li>
<li><strong>%time%</strong>: The time that the attachment was added to WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>%title%</strong>: The human-readable title of the attachment.</li>
<li><strong>%title_attribute%</strong>: The escaped title (above), safe for using HTML tag attributes.</li>
</ul>,<p>Below is an example that uses all three above filter methods to convert the output from a div-based<br>
layout to a table-based layout with no icons, displaying the date of upload in the left column and<br>
the title as a hyperlink to the attachment in the right column.</p>,<pre><code>function dg_gallery_template($gallery, $use_descriptions) {
     if ( ! $use_descriptions ) {
         $gallery = '&lt;table id=""%id%"" class=""%class%"" %data%&gt;%rows%&lt;/table&gt;';
     }
     return $gallery;
 }
 add_filter( 'dg_gallery_template', 'dg_gallery_template', 10, 2 );

 function dg_row_template($row, $use_descriptions) {
     if ( ! $use_descriptions ) {
         $row = '&lt;tr class=""%class%""&gt;%icons%&lt;/tr&gt;';
     }
     return $row;
 }
 add_filter( 'dg_row_template', 'dg_row_template', 10, 2 );

 function dg_icon_template($icon, $use_descriptions, $id) {
     if ( ! $use_descriptions ) {
         $icon = '&lt;td&gt;%date%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""%link%"" target=""%target%""&gt;&lt;span class=""title""&gt;%title%&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/td&gt;';
     }
     return $icon;
 }
 add_filter( 'dg_icon_template', 'dg_icon_template', 10, 3 );
</code></pre>,<p><strong>Filter Thumbnail Generation Methods</strong></p>,<p>Document Gallery provides the <code>dg_thumbers</code> filter, which allows developers to<br>
add, remove, or even re-order which methods are used to generate a thumbnail<br>
for a given attachment.</p>,<p>The value being filtered is an array of <code>DG_AbstractThumber</code> objects. You will want to look at this abstract class,<br>
located in the DG source under <code>inc/thumbers</code> to see how to correctly implement the abstract methods. You’ll notice<br>
that <code>DG_AbstractThumber::init()</code> will handle creating a singleton instance of your class (though you can opt not<br>
to use this logic if you prefer). To register your implementation of <code>DG_AbstractThumber</code> using <code>init()</code>, you would<br>
simply call YourThumberClass::init() and all of the work setting up the <code>dg_thumbers</code> filter to include your thumber<br>
will be done for you.</p>,<p>The following is an example taken from the Document Gallery source (with a few<br>
modifications for ease of readability), where we add thumbnail generation for<br>
all Audio/Video filetypes supported by WordPress:</p>,<pre><code>class ImageThumber extends DG_AbstractThumber {

    /**
     * @return string[] The extensions supported by this thumber.
     */
    protected function getThumberExtensions() {
        return array( 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'jpe', 'gif', 'png' );
    }

    /**
     * @param string $ID The attachment ID to retrieve thumbnail from.
     * @param int $pg Unused.
     *
     * @return bool|string  False on failure, URL to thumb on success.
     */
    public function getThumbnail( $ID, $pg = 1 ) {
        $options = DG_Thumber::getOptions();
        $ret     = false;

        if ( $icon = image_downsize( $ID, array( $options['width'], $options['height'] ) ) ) {
            $ret = $icon[0];
        }

        return $ret;
    }

    /**
     * @return int An integer from 0 to 100. Higher priorities will be attempted before lower priority thumbers.
     */
    public function getPriority() {
        return 100;
    }
 }

 // tells DG_AbstractThumber to create an instance of the class and apply to dg_thumbers filter
 ImageThumber::init();
</code></pre>,<p><strong>Filter Inclusion of Default Document Gallery CSS</strong></p>,<p>If you wish to completely replace Document Gallery styling with your own CSS, you can prevent any any<br>
CSS being loaded by returning false in <code>dg_use_default_gallery_style</code> filter, like so:<br>
    add_filter(‘dg_use_default_gallery_style’, ‘__return_false’);</p>,<p><em>NOTE: By design, this will <strong>NOT</strong> disable inclusion of any custom CSS set at<br>
    Dashboard -&gt; Settings -&gt; Document Gallery</em></p>,<p><strong>Modify Gallery Query</strong></p>,<p>If you wish to modify the query used by Document Gallery to retrieve attachments to be included in a gallery then<br>
the <code>dg_query</code> action allows you to do exactly that. The signature for the action<br>
is <code>function dg_query(&amp;$query, $taxa, &amp;$excluded_keys, &amp;$errs)</code>. Each parameter is described below:</p>,<ul>
<li><strong>&amp;$query</strong>: This is the query to be modified as documented in <a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query"" rel=""nofollow"">WordPress Codex</a>.</li>
<li><strong>$taxa</strong>: The list of key/value pairs for arguments passed into <code>[dg]</code> that do not match known keys.</li>
<li><strong>&amp;$excluded_keys</strong>: The list of keys to not be processed by DG. If your extension uses a key and is not intended for<br>
DG to process, then the key should be added to this list.</li>
<li><strong>&amp;$errs</strong>: The list of errors. If something goes wrong, this list should be appended with a description of what happened.</li>

is being used.</p><p>If you do not wish to filter by parent, <code>id=-1</code> will match all attachments.</p><p><strong>IDs Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.2)</em></p><p>This is an advanced option intended for experienced WordPress users. If this<br>
option is used, the plugin will ignore attached documents, instead including<br>
all attachments defined by the <code>ids</code> attribute (e.g.: <code>ids=10,2,4,42</code>).</p><p><em>Note: If this attribute is used, order defaults to the order of IDs given<br>
rather than menu_order unless order is explicitly stated.</em></p><p><strong>Images Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.2)</em></p><p>This option will tell the plugin to include all images attached to to a page or<br>
post in addition to all documents.</p><p><strong>Include/Exclude Options</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.0)</em></p><p>As the name suggests, these options allow for explicitly adding or removing<br>
matched attachments in your gallery. Like with the IDs options above, these<br>
options take a comma-delimited list of attachment IDs.</p><p><strong>Limit Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 2.3)</em></p><p>As the name suggests, this value will limit how many results are returned in the gallery.<br>
If set to <em>-1</em>, the limit is infinite.</p><p><strong>MIME Types Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.0)</em></p><p>This is a comma-delimited list of all<br>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type#List_of_common_media_types"" rel=""nofollow"">MIME types</a><br>
to be included in the gallery. Most users will not need to modify this value.</p><p>One example use-case would be to include images in your gallery (which are<br>
not included by default). To do this, you would simply set<br>
    mime_types=application,video,text,audio,image, where “image” is the only difference<br>
from the default value. You could also create a gallery which only includes PDFs<br>
by setting <code>mime_types=application/pdf</code>.</p><p><strong>New Window Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 3.2)</em></p><p>If true, clicking one of the documents in your gallery will open the target link in a new window/tab.</p><p><strong>Order Option</strong></p><p>This option works alongside the <code>orderby</code> option to determine whether the<br>
documents are displayed in ascending or descending order.</p><p><strong>Orderby Option</strong></p><ul>
<li><code>menu_order</code> – This is probably the one you want to use. Menu order is<br>
the order that icons appear when seen in the Insert / Upload Media Gallery<br>
dialog. To change this order, you simply drag the icons around until they<br>
are where you want them. In earlier versions of WordPress, menu_order was<br>
modified by the integer fields in the Insert / Upload Media Gallery dialog.<br>
These fields no longer exist in recent releases.</li>
<li><code>title</code> – Order by title.</li>
<li><code>date</code> – Order by upload date.</li>
<li><code>modified</code> – Order by last modified date.</li>
<li><code>rand</code> – Random order.</li>
<li><code>ID</code> – Order by post id.</li>
<li><code>author</code> – Order by author.</li>
<li><code>name</code> – Order by attachment slug.</li>
<li><code>parent</code> – Order by post/page parent id.<br>
(Only useful in conjunction with <code>localpost=false</code> option.)</li>
<li><code>comment_count</code> – Order by number of comments (available with WP &gt;= 2.9).</li>
<li><code>none</code> – No order (available with Version 2.8).</li>
<li><code>post__in</code> – Preserve post ID order given in the post__in array.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Relation Option</strong> <em>(New in Version 1.4)</em></p><p>The relation option should only be used when also using the <em>category or custom<br>
taxonomy</em> option (see above).</p><p>When using multiple taxa this option allows you to decide whether the attachments<br>
returned must match all of the different taxa specified (AND) or a minimum of one<br>
taxa match (OR).</p><p><em>NOTE: This has no bearing on the relationship between different terms for a single<br>
taxon (eg: <code>[dg category=x,y,z relation=AND]</code> will return any attachments where the<br>
category is x, y, OR z). If you wish to return only attachments with all 3 categories,<br>
you will instead need to use the following syntax: <code>[dg category=x,y,z category_relation=AND]</code>.<br>
This syntax of *taxon</em>_relation will work for any taxon, not just “category.”*</p><h4>Customize Appearance</h4><p>The Default Document gallery will often fit quite well with whatever theme you<br>
are using. But, if you want to change things, Document Gallery makes that easy.<br>
Just navigate to <code>Settings -&gt; Document Gallery</code> and put any custom CSS in the<br>
provided text box.</p><p>See <a href=""https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/document-gallery/trunk/assets/css/style.css"" rel=""nofollow""><code>style.css</code></a><br>
for all of the ids and classes being used in a Document Gallery.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><p>Say I would like to include a border for the right and bottom of the document<br>
icon, but only when descriptions are shown (to delineate the icon from the<br>
description text). To do this, I would need to use the following CSS:</p><pre><code>.document-icon-wrapper.descriptions .document-icon{
   border-right: 1px solid #37824A;
   border-bottom: 1px solid #37824A;
}
</code></pre><p>Now, if I wanted to modify that code to instead add the same border to all of<br>
the document-icons, regardless of whether they have a description or not, I<br>
would just change the first line, removing the descriptions class like so:</p><pre><code>.document-icon-wrapper .document-icon
</code></pre><h4>Developers</h4><p>For those unfamiliar with content filters, <a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference"" rel=""nofollow"">here is some<br>
documentation</a> that you<br>
should read before continuing.</p><p><strong>Filter HTML Output</strong></p><p>In Documnet Gallery version 2.2, we’ve released a more powerful HTML<br>
templating framework, making all generated output filterable, and thus<br>
configurable, by developers wishing to control the gallery output. Three<br>
different filters are provided in order to access the various segments<br>
of a gallery: <code>dg_gallery_template</code>, <code>dg_row_template</code>, and <code>dg_icon_template</code>.<br>
These filtered templates are used when dynamically generating output for each<br>
gallery.</p><p>Each of the following filters provides an bool argument which indicates<br>
whither the gallery being generated will display descriptions, which<br>
allows you to handle galleries with and without descriptions differently.</p><p>If you wish to wrap your galleries in some additional content,<br>
the <code>dg_gallery_template</code> is the tool for the job. With it you can include<br>
content prior to or following your document galleries. The filter<br>
exposes 2 special tags which are replaced during gallery generation<br>
with data specific to that gallery. The tag is described below:</p><ul>
<li><strong>%id%</strong>: The id attribute value for this gallery.</li>
<li><strong>%class%</strong>: The class attribute value for this gallery.</li>
<li><strong>%data%</strong>: The one ore more data-* attributes for the gallery, which are necessary for client-side operations.</li>
<li><strong>%rows%</strong>: This tag is replaced by all of the document gallery rows.<br>
Everything before this string will be rendered before the gallery and<br>
everything after this string will be rendered following the gallery.</li>
</ul><p>If you wish to modify how gallery rows are generated, <code>dg_row_template</code>,<br>
is provided for this purpose. This filter gives you control at the row<br>
level for how a gallery will be generated. The filter exposes 2 special tags<br>
which are replaced during gallery generation with row-specific data.<br>
These tags are as follows:</p><ul>
<li><strong>%class%</strong>: The class attribute value for this row.</li>
<li><strong>%icons%</strong>: The icon data for this row.</li>
</ul><p>If you wish to modify the HTML that wraps individual icons,<br>
the <code>dg_icon_template</code> filter is what you will use. The filter is passed<br>
two arguments which may be used to gain additional information about<br>
the document that will be used in generating this icon. The first<br>
argument is a bool value which indicates whether descriptions will<br>
be used along with the icon and the second value is an integer WordPress<br>
attachment ID which may be used to lookup any relevant information<br>
you need specific to that document. The filter exposes 5 special tags<br>
which are replaced during gallery generation with document-specific data.<br>
These tags are as follows:</p><ul>
<li><strong>%date%</strong>: The date that the attachment was added to WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>%description%</strong>: The attachment description (only present when rendering descriptions).</li>
<li><strong>%extension%</strong>: The document file extension.</li>
<li><strong>%img%</strong>: The URL pointing the the image that will be displayed.</li>
<li><strong>%link%</strong>: The URL that will be loaded when the user clicks the icon.</li>
<li><strong>%path%</strong>: The system path pointing to the document.</li>
<li><strong>%size%</strong>: The human-readable file size formatted by<br>
<a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/size_format"" rel=""nofollow"">size_format</a>.</li>
<li><strong>%target%</strong>: The target attribute for the anchor tag (e.g.: _blank, _self).</li>
<li><strong>%time%</strong>: The time that the attachment was added to WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>%title%</strong>: The human-readable title of the attachment.</li>
<li><strong>%title_attribute%</strong>: The escaped title (above), safe for using HTML tag attributes.</li>
</ul><p>Below is an example that uses all three above filter methods to convert the output from a div-based<br>
layout to a table-based layout with no icons, displaying the date of upload in the left column and<br>
the title as a hyperlink to the attachment in the right column.</p><pre><code>function dg_gallery_template($gallery, $use_descriptions) {
     if ( ! $use_descriptions ) {
         $gallery = '&lt;table id=""%id%"" class=""%class%"" %data%&gt;%rows%&lt;/table&gt;';
     }
     return $gallery;
 }
 add_filter( 'dg_gallery_template', 'dg_gallery_template', 10, 2 );

 function dg_row_template($row, $use_descriptions) {
     if ( ! $use_descriptions ) {
         $row = '&lt;tr class=""%class%""&gt;%icons%&lt;/tr&gt;';
     }
     return $row;
 }
 add_filter( 'dg_row_template', 'dg_row_template', 10, 2 );

 function dg_icon_template($icon, $use_descriptions, $id) {
     if ( ! $use_descriptions ) {
         $icon = '&lt;td&gt;%date%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""%link%"" target=""%target%""&gt;&lt;span class=""title""&gt;%title%&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/td&gt;';
     }
     return $icon;
 }
 add_filter( 'dg_icon_template', 'dg_icon_template', 10, 3 );
</code></pre><p><strong>Filter Thumbnail Generation Methods</strong></p><p>Document Gallery provides the <code>dg_thumbers</code> filter, which allows developers to<br>
add, remove, or even re-order which methods are used to generate a thumbnail<br>
for a given attachment.</p><p>The value being filtered is an array of <code>DG_AbstractThumber</code> objects. You will want to look at this abstract class,<br>
located in the DG source under <code>inc/thumbers</code> to see how to correctly implement the abstract methods. You’ll notice<br>
that <code>DG_AbstractThumber::init()</code> will handle creating a singleton instance of your class (though you can opt not<br>
to use this logic if you prefer). To register your implementation of <code>DG_AbstractThumber</code> using <code>init()</code>, you would<br>
simply call YourThumberClass::init() and all of the work setting up the <code>dg_thumbers</code> filter to include your thumber<br>
will be done for you.</p><p>The following is an example taken from the Document Gallery source (with a few<br>
modifications for ease of readability), where we add thumbnail generation for<br>
all Audio/Video filetypes supported by WordPress:</p><pre><code>class ImageThumber extends DG_AbstractThumber {

    /**
     * @return string[] The extensions supported by this thumber.
     */
    protected function getThumberExtensions() {
        return array( 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'jpe', 'gif', 'png' );
    }

    /**
     * @param string $ID The attachment ID to retrieve thumbnail from.
     * @param int $pg Unused.
     *
     * @return bool|string  False on failure, URL to thumb on success.
     */
    public function getThumbnail( $ID, $pg = 1 ) {
        $options = DG_Thumber::getOptions();
        $ret     = false;

        if ( $icon = image_downsize( $ID, array( $options['width'], $options['height'] ) ) ) {
            $ret = $icon[0];
        }

        return $ret;
    }

    /**
     * @return int An integer from 0 to 100. Higher priorities will be attempted before lower priority thumbers.
     */
    public function getPriority() {
        return 100;
    }
 }

 // tells DG_AbstractThumber to create an instance of the class and apply to dg_thumbers filter
 ImageThumber::init();
</code></pre><p><strong>Filter Inclusion of Default Document Gallery CSS</strong></p><p>If you wish to completely replace Document Gallery styling with your own CSS, you can prevent any any<br>
CSS being loaded by returning false in <code>dg_use_default_gallery_style</code> filter, like so:<br>
    add_filter(‘dg_use_default_gallery_style’, ‘__return_false’);</p><p><em>NOTE: By design, this will <strong>NOT</strong> disable inclusion of any custom CSS set at<br>
    Dashboard -&gt; Settings -&gt; Document Gallery</em></p><p><strong>Modify Gallery Query</strong></p><p>If you wish to modify the query used by Document Gallery to retrieve attachments to be included in a gallery then<br>
the <code>dg_query</code> action allows you to do exactly that. The signature for the action<br>
is <code>function dg_query(&amp;$query, $taxa, &amp;$excluded_keys, &amp;$errs)</code>. Each parameter is described below:</p><ul>
<li><strong>&amp;$query</strong>: This is the query to be modified as documented in <a href=""https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query"" rel=""nofollow"">WordPress Codex</a>.</li>
<li><strong>$taxa</strong>: The list of key/value pairs for arguments passed into <code>[dg]</code> that do not match known keys.</li>
<li><strong>&amp;$excluded_keys</strong>: The list of keys to not be processed by DG. If your extension uses a key and is not intended for<br>
DG to process, then the key should be added to this list.</li>
<li><strong>&amp;$errs</strong>: The list of errors. If something goes wrong, this list should be appended with a description of what happened.</li>

</li>
</ol>,<p>The widget will now be available in the ‘Widgets’ admin page.<br>
As long as you already have at least one Custom Menu defined, you can add the new widget to a sidebar and configure it however you want.<br>
Alternatively, you can use the shortcode in your content.</p>,<p>Current documentation for the <strong>Widget Options</strong> can be found<br>
under <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/"">Other Notes</a>.</p>,<h4>SHORTCODE ATTRIBUTES</h4>,<p>The shortcode is <strong><code>[cmwizard]</code></strong>.<br>
Most of the attributes reflect the options available to the widget, but some have been simplified for easier use in the shortcode format.<br>
If there are no menu items as a result of the filtering, then there will be no output from the shortcode.</p>,<p>The simplest way to build a shortcode is to use a widget : as you set options, the equivalent shortcode is displayed at the base of<br>
the widget (v3+) and the base of the “assist”. The widget itself need not be assigned to a widget area, so you can construct your<br>
shortcode using a widget in the Inactive Widgets area if you have no need for an active one.</p>,<p>Note that as long as you are <strong>not</strong> using the <code>widget=N</code> attribute, then you don’t need to save the widget itself :<br>
just copy-paste the shortcode when you are happy with it.</p>,<h4>widget</h4>,<p><em>integer</em> : <strong>!NEW!</strong> <em>from v3.1.5</em>, the shortcode will accept a <code>widget=N</code> attribute which will load an<br>
existing widget instance.</p>,<p>The shortcode – resembling <strong><code>[cmwizard widget=N/]</code></strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is an integer – is provided at the base<br>
of each widget, below the widget’s “equivalent” shortcode.</p>,<p>It will look for the instance in all active sidebars, <em>and</em> the Inactive Widgets area.<br>
You can prevent inspection of the Inactive Widgets area by adding an <code>inactive=0</code> attribute.<br>
It will <strong><em>not</em></strong> look in any other <em>Inactive Sidebar…</em> area unless you specifically tell it to do so by<br>
adding an <code>orphaned=1</code> attribute.</p>,<p>Using this attribute reduces the shortcode length, and may cut down on maintenance where<br>
you have the same shortcode in a number of places … as long as you are prepared to keep the widget instance (even if it’s in the<br>
Inactive Widgets area). You can override the widget instance’s settings by supplying any of the other standard shortcode attributes.</p>,<p>Note that you can’t use this attribute as part of an Alternative setting (it is simply ignored).</p>,<h4>title</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : The output’s <code>Title</code>, which may be overridden by <strong>title_from</strong>. Note that there is no shortcode equivalent of the widget’s <code>Hide</code> option for the title.</p>,<h4>menu</h4>,<p><em>string or integer</em> : Accepts a menu name or id. If not provided, the shortcode will attempt to find the first menu (alphabetically)<br>
that has menu items attached to it, and use that.</p>,<h4>level</h4>,<p><em>integer</em> : Sets the <code>Level</code> filter to the specified (greater than zero) value. Defaults to 1, and is ignored if either <strong>branch</strong> or <strong>items</strong> is specified.</p>,<h4>branch</h4>,<p><em>string or integer</em> : If not empty then <code>Branch</code> is set as the primary filter, with the branch item being set from the assigned value:</p>,<ul>
<li>If numeric, it is taken as being the id of a menu item.</li>
<li>If set to either <em>“current”</em> or <em>“current-item”</em> then the <code>Branch</code> item is set to “Current Item”.</li>
<li>If any other string, it is taken to be the title of a menu item (within the selected menu). The widget will look for the first <em>caseless</em> title match, so specifying <code>branch=""my menu item""</code> will match against a menu item with the title “My Menu Item”.</li>
</ul>,<h4>items</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : Comma-separated list of meu item ids, where an id can optionally be followed by a ‘+’ to include all its descendants (eg. “23+”). Takes priority over <strong>branch</strong>.</p>,<h4>start_at</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : This is only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter, and consists of a signed or unsigned integer that indicates either a relative<br>
(to the selected branch item) or absolute level to start your output at (ref. the widget’s <code>Starting at</code> option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>).<br>
By default the starting level for output is the branch item’s level. A relative level is indicated by a signed (ie. preceded by<br>
a “+” or “-“) integer, eg. <code>start_at=""+1""</code>, while an absolute level is unsigned, eg. <code>start_at=""1""</code>. Some examples :</p>,<ul>
<li><code>start_at=""+1""</code> : (relative) start at the branch item’s level + 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=""children""</code>)</li>
<li><code>start_at=""-1""</code> : (relative) start at the branch item’s level – 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=""parent""</code>)</li>
<li><code>start_at=""-2""</code> : (relative) would be the “grandparent” level</li>
<li><code>start_at=""1""</code> : (absolute) start at the root item of the selected branch (also accepts <code>start_at=""root""</code>)</li>
<li><code>start_at=""2""</code> : (absolute) start at one level below root (still within the selected branch)</li>
</ul>,<h4>start_mode</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : This has only one accepted value – “level” – and is only applicable for a <code>Branch</code> filter whose <strong>start_at</strong> setting returns<br>
in an item that is at or above the selected branch item (relatively or absolutely).<br>
Setting <code>start_mode=""level""</code> forces the widget to use not only the resultant starting item<br>
and its relevant descendants, but also all that item’s siblings <em>and their descendants</em><br>
(ref. the widget’s <code>Level</code> radio option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>).</p>,<h4>allow_all_root</h4>,<p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget’s <code>Allow all Root Items</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>.</p>,<h4>depth</h4>,<p><em>integer, default 0 (unlimited)</em> : See widget’s <code>For Depth</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>.</p>,<h4>depth_rel_current</h4>,<p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget’s <code>Relative to Current Item</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>.</p>,<h4>ancestors</h4>,<p><em>integer, default 0 (off)</em> : Sets an absolute level (positive integer), or a relative number of levels (negative integer), for which<br>
the ancestors of the <code>Branch</code> filter item should be included. See widget’s <code>Branch Ancestors</code> option, under <em>Inclusions</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>. (only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter)</p>,<h4>ancestor_siblings</h4>,<p><em>integer, default 0 (off)</em> : Sets an absolute level (positive integer), or a relative number of levels (negative integer), for which<br>
the siblings of ancestors of the <code>Branch</code> filter item should be included. See widget’s <code>... with Siblings</code> option, under <em>Inclusions</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>. (only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter)</p>,<h4>siblings</h4>,<p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget’s <code>Branch Siblings</code> option, under <em>Inclusions</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>. (only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter)</p>,<h4>include_level</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : A level (1, 2, 3, etc), optionally followed by a “+” or “-” to include all subsequent (lower) or prior (higher)<br>
levels respectively. For example :</p>,<ul>
<li><code>include_level=""2""</code> : include all items at level 2</li>
<li><code>include_level=""2-""</code> : include all level 1 <strong>and</strong> level 2 items</li>
<li><code>include_level=""2+""</code> : include all items at level 2 or greater.</li>
</ul>,<p>Note that prior to v3.0.4, this was <strong>include_root</strong> (a switch), which only included the root level : <code>include_root=1</code> is still accepted, even<br>
though now deprecated, and is equivalent to setting <code>include_level=""1""</code>. However, if <strong>include_level</strong> is specified then it takes precedence.</p>,<h4>exclude</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : Comma-separated list of meu item ids, where an id can optionally be followed by a ‘+’ to include all its descendants (eg. “23+”).</p>,<h4>exclude_level</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : A level (1, 2, 3, etc), optionally followed by a “+” or “-” to exclude all subsequent (lower) or prior (higher)<br>
levels respectively. See the examples for <strong>include_level</strong> above.</p>,<h4>contains_current</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : Accepted values : “menu”, “primary”, “secondary”, “inclusions”, or “output”. See widget’s <em>Qualifier</em> options,<br>
under <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>,<br>
for an explanation of the respective settings.</p>,<h4>fallback</h4>,<p><em>string</em> : This enables the widget’s <em>If Current Item has no children</em> fallback (ref. <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Fallbacks-Section"">Fallbacks Section</a>)…</p>,<ul>
<li><em>“parent”</em> : Sets the widget’s Fallback option to “Start at : -1 (parent)”</li>
<li><em>“current”</em> : Sets the widget’s Fallback option to “Start at : the Current Item”</li>
<li><em>“quit”</em> : Sets the widget’s Fallback option to “No output!”</li>
</ul>,<p>The first two values can be further qualified by appending a comma and a digit, eg. <code>fallback=""current,1""</code><br>
or <code>fallback=""parent,2""</code>, which will also set the widget’s <code>For Depth</code> fallback option to the value of the<br>
digit(s).</p>,<p>Optionally, “+siblings” can also be used (comma-separated, with or without a depth digit) to indicate that<br>

</code></pre>,<p>Note that Alternative (eg. “branch=current”) does not require a <code>menu</code> option, because you can’t change the menu so the primary<br>
configuration’s setting is always used.</p>,<p>As ever, the best way to construct a full shortcode, including an alternative, is to use the Assist : Use one instance of the CMW<br>
widget to build your Alternative settings, copy the equivalent shortcode into the Alternative option of a second instance of the CMW<br>
widget, and then continue configuring that second instance to be your primary configuration; your final shortcode can simply be lifted<br>
from the second instance!</p>,<p>A bit more information about the Alternative option is available<br>

<li>
<p>EITHER Upload the zip package via ‘Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload’ in your WP Admin</p>
<p>OR Extract the zip package and upload <code>custom-menu-wizard</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</p>

<li>
<p>Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in your WP Admin</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The widget will now be available in the ‘Widgets’ admin page.<br>
As long as you already have at least one Custom Menu defined, you can add the new widget to a sidebar and configure it however you want.<br>
Alternatively, you can use the shortcode in your content.</p><p>Current documentation for the <strong>Widget Options</strong> can be found<br>
under <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/"">Other Notes</a>.</p><h4>SHORTCODE ATTRIBUTES</h4><p>The shortcode is <strong><code>[cmwizard]</code></strong>.<br>
Most of the attributes reflect the options available to the widget, but some have been simplified for easier use in the shortcode format.<br>
If there are no menu items as a result of the filtering, then there will be no output from the shortcode.</p><p>The simplest way to build a shortcode is to use a widget : as you set options, the equivalent shortcode is displayed at the base of<br>
the widget (v3+) and the base of the “assist”. The widget itself need not be assigned to a widget area, so you can construct your<br>
shortcode using a widget in the Inactive Widgets area if you have no need for an active one.</p><p>Note that as long as you are <strong>not</strong> using the <code>widget=N</code> attribute, then you don’t need to save the widget itself :<br>
just copy-paste the shortcode when you are happy with it.</p><h4>widget</h4><p><em>integer</em> : <strong>!NEW!</strong> <em>from v3.1.5</em>, the shortcode will accept a <code>widget=N</code> attribute which will load an<br>
existing widget instance.</p><p>The shortcode – resembling <strong><code>[cmwizard widget=N/]</code></strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is an integer – is provided at the base<br>
of each widget, below the widget’s “equivalent” shortcode.</p><p>It will look for the instance in all active sidebars, <em>and</em> the Inactive Widgets area.<br>
You can prevent inspection of the Inactive Widgets area by adding an <code>inactive=0</code> attribute.<br>
It will <strong><em>not</em></strong> look in any other <em>Inactive Sidebar…</em> area unless you specifically tell it to do so by<br>
adding an <code>orphaned=1</code> attribute.</p><p>Using this attribute reduces the shortcode length, and may cut down on maintenance where<br>
you have the same shortcode in a number of places … as long as you are prepared to keep the widget instance (even if it’s in the<br>
Inactive Widgets area). You can override the widget instance’s settings by supplying any of the other standard shortcode attributes.</p><p>Note that you can’t use this attribute as part of an Alternative setting (it is simply ignored).</p><h4>title</h4><p><em>string</em> : The output’s <code>Title</code>, which may be overridden by <strong>title_from</strong>. Note that there is no shortcode equivalent of the widget’s <code>Hide</code> option for the title.</p><h4>menu</h4><p><em>string or integer</em> : Accepts a menu name or id. If not provided, the shortcode will attempt to find the first menu (alphabetically)<br>
that has menu items attached to it, and use that.</p><h4>level</h4><p><em>integer</em> : Sets the <code>Level</code> filter to the specified (greater than zero) value. Defaults to 1, and is ignored if either <strong>branch</strong> or <strong>items</strong> is specified.</p><h4>branch</h4><p><em>string or integer</em> : If not empty then <code>Branch</code> is set as the primary filter, with the branch item being set from the assigned value:</p><ul>
<li>If numeric, it is taken as being the id of a menu item.</li>
<li>If set to either <em>“current”</em> or <em>“current-item”</em> then the <code>Branch</code> item is set to “Current Item”.</li>
<li>If any other string, it is taken to be the title of a menu item (within the selected menu). The widget will look for the first <em>caseless</em> title match, so specifying <code>branch=""my menu item""</code> will match against a menu item with the title “My Menu Item”.</li>
</ul><h4>items</h4><p><em>string</em> : Comma-separated list of meu item ids, where an id can optionally be followed by a ‘+’ to include all its descendants (eg. “23+”). Takes priority over <strong>branch</strong>.</p><h4>start_at</h4><p><em>string</em> : This is only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter, and consists of a signed or unsigned integer that indicates either a relative<br>
(to the selected branch item) or absolute level to start your output at (ref. the widget’s <code>Starting at</code> option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>).<br>
By default the starting level for output is the branch item’s level. A relative level is indicated by a signed (ie. preceded by<br>
a “+” or “-“) integer, eg. <code>start_at=""+1""</code>, while an absolute level is unsigned, eg. <code>start_at=""1""</code>. Some examples :</p><ul>
<li><code>start_at=""+1""</code> : (relative) start at the branch item’s level + 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=""children""</code>)</li>
<li><code>start_at=""-1""</code> : (relative) start at the branch item’s level – 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=""parent""</code>)</li>
<li><code>start_at=""-2""</code> : (relative) would be the “grandparent” level</li>
<li><code>start_at=""1""</code> : (absolute) start at the root item of the selected branch (also accepts <code>start_at=""root""</code>)</li>
<li><code>start_at=""2""</code> : (absolute) start at one level below root (still within the selected branch)</li>
</ul><h4>start_mode</h4><p><em>string</em> : This has only one accepted value – “level” – and is only applicable for a <code>Branch</code> filter whose <strong>start_at</strong> setting returns<br>
in an item that is at or above the selected branch item (relatively or absolutely).<br>
Setting <code>start_mode=""level""</code> forces the widget to use not only the resultant starting item<br>
and its relevant descendants, but also all that item’s siblings <em>and their descendants</em><br>
(ref. the widget’s <code>Level</code> radio option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>).</p><h4>allow_all_root</h4><p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget’s <code>Allow all Root Items</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>.</p><h4>depth</h4><p><em>integer, default 0 (unlimited)</em> : See widget’s <code>For Depth</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>.</p><h4>depth_rel_current</h4><p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget’s <code>Relative to Current Item</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>.</p><h4>ancestors</h4><p><em>integer, default 0 (off)</em> : Sets an absolute level (positive integer), or a relative number of levels (negative integer), for which<br>
the ancestors of the <code>Branch</code> filter item should be included. See widget’s <code>Branch Ancestors</code> option, under <em>Inclusions</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>. (only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter)</p><h4>ancestor_siblings</h4><p><em>integer, default 0 (off)</em> : Sets an absolute level (positive integer), or a relative number of levels (negative integer), for which<br>
the siblings of ancestors of the <code>Branch</code> filter item should be included. See widget’s <code>... with Siblings</code> option, under <em>Inclusions</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>. (only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter)</p><h4>siblings</h4><p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget’s <code>Branch Siblings</code> option, under <em>Inclusions</em>,<br>
<a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>. (only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter)</p><h4>include_level</h4><p><em>string</em> : A level (1, 2, 3, etc), optionally followed by a “+” or “-” to include all subsequent (lower) or prior (higher)<br>
levels respectively. For example :</p><ul>
<li><code>include_level=""2""</code> : include all items at level 2</li>
<li><code>include_level=""2-""</code> : include all level 1 <strong>and</strong> level 2 items</li>
<li><code>include_level=""2+""</code> : include all items at level 2 or greater.</li>
</ul><p>Note that prior to v3.0.4, this was <strong>include_root</strong> (a switch), which only included the root level : <code>include_root=1</code> is still accepted, even<br>
though now deprecated, and is equivalent to setting <code>include_level=""1""</code>. However, if <strong>include_level</strong> is specified then it takes precedence.</p><h4>exclude</h4><p><em>string</em> : Comma-separated list of meu item ids, where an id can optionally be followed by a ‘+’ to include all its descendants (eg. “23+”).</p><h4>exclude_level</h4><p><em>string</em> : A level (1, 2, 3, etc), optionally followed by a “+” or “-” to exclude all subsequent (lower) or prior (higher)<br>
levels respectively. See the examples for <strong>include_level</strong> above.</p><h4>contains_current</h4><p><em>string</em> : Accepted values : “menu”, “primary”, “secondary”, “inclusions”, or “output”. See widget’s <em>Qualifier</em> options,<br>
under <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section"">Filters Section</a>,<br>
for an explanation of the respective settings.</p><h4>fallback</h4><p><em>string</em> : This enables the widget’s <em>If Current Item has no children</em> fallback (ref. <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Fallbacks-Section"">Fallbacks Section</a>)…</p><ul>
<li><em>“parent”</em> : Sets the widget’s Fallback option to “Start at : -1 (parent)”</li>
<li><em>“current”</em> : Sets the widget’s Fallback option to “Start at : the Current Item”</li>
<li><em>“quit”</em> : Sets the widget’s Fallback option to “No output!”</li>
</ul><p>The first two values can be further qualified by appending a comma and a digit, eg. <code>fallback=""current,1""</code><br>
or <code>fallback=""parent,2""</code>, which will also set the widget’s <code>For Depth</code> fallback option to the value of the<br>
digit(s).</p><p>Optionally, “+siblings” can also be used (comma-separated, with or without a depth digit) to indicate that<br>
siblings of the “parent” or “current” fallback item should also be included. The order of the comma-separated<br>
values is not important, so <code>fallback=""current,+siblings,1""</code> is the same as <code>fallback=""current,1,+siblings""</code>,<br>
and <code>fallback=""2,parent""</code> is the same as <code>fallback=""parent,2""</code>, etc.</p><h4>fallback_ci_parent</h4><p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget’s <em>If no Current Item can be found</em> entry in the<br>

“show Current Branch plus kids” if a current item <em>can</em> be found within the menu…</p><pre><code>[cmwizard menu=NN depth=2 alternative=""current,menu""]branch=current[/cmwizard]
</code></pre><p>Note that Alternative (eg. “branch=current”) does not require a <code>menu</code> option, because you can’t change the menu so the primary<br>
configuration’s setting is always used.</p><p>As ever, the best way to construct a full shortcode, including an alternative, is to use the Assist : Use one instance of the CMW<br>
widget to build your Alternative settings, copy the equivalent shortcode into the Alternative option of a second instance of the CMW<br>
widget, and then continue configuring that second instance to be your primary configuration; your final shortcode can simply be lifted<br>
from the second instance!</p><p>A bit more information about the Alternative option is available<br>
in <a href=""http://www.wizzud.com/2014/10/03/custom-menu-wizard-wordpress-plugin-version-3-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>.</p><h4>title_tag</h4><p><em>string</em> : An optional tag name (eg. “h1”, “h3”, etc) to replace the default “h2” used to enclose the widget title.<br>
Please note that this attribute has no equivalent in the widget options, because it <em>only</em> applies when a widget is instantiated via a shortcode.</p><h4>findme</h4><p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : This is a utility intended for editors only, and output is restricted to those with edit_pages capability.<br>
If enabled it will return a list of posts that contain a CMW shortcode. If <code>findme</code> is set, the only other attribute that is taken any<br>
notice of is <code>title</code>, which will be output (if supplied) as an H3 in front of the list. Example :</p><pre><code>[cmwizard findme=1 title=""Posts containing a CMW shortcode...""/]
</code></pre><p>Note that the information provided by this utility is also available from any widget’s “assist”.</p><h4>SHORTCODE EXAMPLES</h4><ul>
<li>
<p>Show the entire “main” menu</p>
<pre><code>[cmwizard menu=main/]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show the children of the current menu item within the “main” menu, for unlimited depth, setting the widget title from the current menu item</p>
<pre><code>[cmwizard menu=main branch=current start_at=children title_from=current/]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the “animals” menu, show all the items <em>immediately</em> below “Small Dogs”, plus “Small Dogs” and its sibling items, as ordered lists</p>
<pre><code>[cmwizard menu=""animals"" branch=""small dogs"" depth=2 include=""siblings"" ol_root=1 ol_sub=1/]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the “animals” menu, show the entire “Small Animals” branch, with the sole exception of the “Small Animals” item itself, whenever “Small Animals” or one of its descendants is the current menu item</p>
<pre><code>[cmwizard menu=""animals"" branch=""small animals"" start_at=children contains_current=primary/]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show the entire “main” menu entitled “Main Menu” <em>unless</em> there’s a current menu item, in which case show the current menu item, its siblings and its immediate children, and entitle it “Nearest and Dearest!”</p>
